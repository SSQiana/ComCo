# Fusion3M: Community-based Multi-scale Co-evolving Network for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning


Most of the used original dynamic graph datasets come from [Towards Better Evaluation for Dynamic Link Prediction](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1GVpwr2Tfdg), 
which can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7213796#.Y1cO6y8r30o). 

We are grateful to the authors of [DyGFormer](https://github.com/yule-BUAA/DyGLib) for making their project codes publicly available.
